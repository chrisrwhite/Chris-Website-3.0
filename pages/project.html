						<!-- insert paragraphs with text-->
						<p>Welcome to my personal webpage! My name is Christopher White and I graduated from Lafayette College in 2015 with a BS in Mechanical Engineering and minor in Biotechnology. I have a strong passion for engineering design, problem solving, programming and modeling.I enjoy playing the guitar, bike riding, working out, and exploring the outdoors.  I currently live in DC where I enjoy exploring the landmarks and museums. I decided to code my own website and customize it to my own likings and I wanted to showcase some of my projects and interests. On this website you will find some of my engineering lab projects where I examined designs, models, and analyzed data. You will also find some of my programming projects where I developed code to analyze various data sets.  Feel free to explore any of the web pages!</p>

						<p>I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.</p>
